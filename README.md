If you are planning to establish an online presence then you need a website. To make a website live and let everyone use it you require 2 fundamental components, a domain and a hosting to put your work online.
Hostinger provides you both at a super competitive price. If you are looking for a hefty 20% discount then check this link (https://hostinger.com?REFERRALCODE=XSSASHIKUWIC) which will benefit me a little bit also. They offer 99.99% uptime service with multiple server locations to choose from (North america, europe, SEA, South Asia, Eurasia), they got your business covered worldwide.

N.B. The link is 100% secure to visit.
